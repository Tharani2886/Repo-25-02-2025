My practice session for GIT today 25/02/2025 --- first line
I made changes to the test file once after i "add" the file to the staging area (using git rm --cached <file>)
I made recommit to my first commit as "second commit" by using ------ ( git commit --amend -m "New commit message")
this is the line - to check - git diff
